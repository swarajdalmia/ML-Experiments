## Desire for computers to see 
Smartphones have cameras, and taking a photo or video and sharing it has never been easier, resulting in the incredible growth of modern social networks like Instagram.

YouTube might be the second largest search engine and hundreds of hours of video are uploaded every minute and billions of videos are watched every day.

The internet is comprised of text and images. It is relatively straightforward to index and search text, but in order to index and search images, algorithms need to know what the images contain. For the longest time, the content of images and video has remained opaque, best described using the meta descriptions provided by the person that uploaded them.

This is a trivial problem for a human, even young children.

- A person can describe the content of a photograph they have seen once.
- A person can summarize a video that they have only seen once.
- A person can recognize a face that they have only seen once before.

The goal of computer vision is to understand the content of digital images. Typically, this involves developing methods that attempt to reproduce the capability of human vision.

Understanding the content of digital images may involve extracting a description from the image, which may be an object, a text description, a three-dimensional model, and so on

## Tasks in Computer Vision

A list of some high-level problems where we have seen success with computer vision.
- Optical character recognition (OCR)
- Machine inspection
- Retail (e.g. automated checkouts)
- 3D model building (photogrammetry)
- Medical imaging
- Automotive safety
- Match move (e.g. merging CGI with live actors in movies)
- Motion capture (mocap)
- Surveillance
- Fingerprint recognition and biometrics

Problem types in CV:
- Object Classification: What broad category of object is in this photograph?
- Object Identification: Which type of a given object is in this photograph?
- Object Verification: Is the object in the photograph?
- Object Detection: Where are the objects in the photograph?
- Object Landmark Detection: What are the key points for the object in the photograph?
- Object Segmentation: What pixels belong to the object in the image?
- Object Recognition: What objects are in this photograph and where are they?
- Content-based image retrieval
- Pose estimation 
- Facial recognition tech, shape recognition tech
- Motion analysis 
- scene reconstruction : Given one or (typically) more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a 3D model of the scene. 
- structure from motion : recreate a 3D model from a video source
- Image restoration : An example in this field is inpainting.
- Context and scene understanding
- Dense motion estimation : finds its applications in video compression, stabilisation and video summarization.
- super resolution : images are created with higher spatial resolution and less noise than regular camera images. very helpful for facial recognition. 
- Colorization
- Object tracking

A lot can be done with videos as well. Predicting what will happen next for example.
