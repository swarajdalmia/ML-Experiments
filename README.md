# Machine Learning Playground 
Contains the implementation of some popular ML/DL models and architectures.

The code used to implement the Recurrent Neuural Networks(RNN) model using Long-Short Term Memory(LSTM) units with a was taken from [here](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/recurrent-neural-networks/blob/master/notebooks/Deep%20Dive%20into%20Recurrent%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb).
