# Machine Learning Playground 
The idea here is to implement and experiment with some of the popular ML/DL models and architectures.

The code is run in Jupyter Labs using a virtual environment. The packages present in the virtual envionment can be found in the requirements.txt file. 

## RNN with LSTM Units
The initial code used to implement the Recurrent Neuural Networks(RNN) model using Long-Short Term Memory(LSTM) units with adopted from [here](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/recurrent-neural-networks/blob/master/notebooks/Deep%20Dive%20into%20Recurrent%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb). A beautiful exposition on LSTM's can be found on [colah's blog](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/). To see the myriad applications and some really breaktaking unexpected results on applying RNN's, look at [Andrej Karpathy blog](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).
