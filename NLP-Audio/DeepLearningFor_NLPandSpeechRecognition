Book : Deep Learning for NLP and Speech Recognition by Uday Kamath, John Liu, James Whitaker - June 2019

## Introduction 

With the advent of deep learning, however, the burden shifts from producing rule based approaches to learning directly from the data. 

Deep learning saw explosive growth, attention, and availability of tools following its success in computer vision in the early 2010s. Natural language processing 
soon experienced many of these same benefits from computer vision. Speech recognition, traditionally a field dominated by feature engineering and model tuning 
techniques, incorporated deep learning into its feature extraction methods resulting in strong gains in quality. 

In many situations when it is not possible to label or annotate the entire dataset due to either cost or lack of expertise or other constraints, 
learning jointly from the labeled and unlabeled data is called semi-supervised learning. Instead of expert labeling of data, if the machine provides 
insight into which data should be labeled, the process is called active learning.

## Ch - 2 (Basics of Machine Learning)

- VC dimension 
- Bias vs Variance 

Confusion Matric 
- AUROC (plots TPR and FPR for a classifier at various thresholds)
- AUPRC (plots precision and recall for a classifier at various thresholds)

In particular, AUPRC is generally considered to be an informative metric in the presence of imbalanced classes.
